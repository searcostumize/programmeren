# Linear Search Web Application

This is a simple web application that demonstrates a linear search algorithm using JavaScript. The application allows users to input an array of values and a search value, and then it performs a linear search to find the index of the search value in the array.

## Features

- Input an array of values (comma-separated)
- Input a value to search for in the array
- Display the index of the search value if found
- Display a message if the search value is not found

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/linear-search-web-app.git
    cd linear-search-web-app
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter an array of values in the "Enter array" input field (comma-separated).

4. Enter a value to search for in the "Enter value to search" input field.

5. Click the "Search" button to perform the linear search.

6. The result will be displayed below the button, showing the index of the search value if found, or a message indicating that the value was not found.

## Example

For example, if you input `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` as the array and `3` as the search value, the result will display:
